# Train-Scheduler
I am creating this train scheduler application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The goal of this application is to retrieve and manipulate this information using Moment.js. Upon completeion, this website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
